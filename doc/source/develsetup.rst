Developer setup
===============

#. Follow `get the source code <http://pythonhosted.org/python-redfish/readme.html#get-the-source-code>`_ section to retrieve the sources.
#. Follow `using pip and virtualenv <http://pythonhosted.org/python-redfish/installation.html#using-pip-and-virtualenv>`_ section to create your environment.

To setup a development environment, the DMTF has published a mockup environment
to simulate a Redfish based system so it is possible to write programs without
real Redfish compliant hardware platform.

Please refer `DMTF Documentation <../../../dmtf/README.rst#docker-container>`_ for detailed steps
for setting up the environment.

You can start hacking the code now.
